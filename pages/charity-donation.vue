      <p>Instead of flowers we would like to suggest people make a donation to Compassion UK, a charity very close to Sylvia's heart</p>
      <h2>Compassion UK</h2>
      <p>Sylvia loved to sponsor children through the Christian charity <em>Compassion UK</em> and we would appreciate your ongoing support for their fantastic work in helping children all over the world.
